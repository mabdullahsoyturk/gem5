INPUT FILE is under ./figs/input.grey

To execute:
./dct 'input file' 'output file' 
A full comparison is as follows:

1) Create Golden
./dct figs/input.grey golden.grey

2) Run simulation with DCT 
./dct figs/input.grey experimentX.grey

3)Get the quality output
./quality figs/input.grey golden.grey experimentX.grey 

======================
The quality returns:
string,float

if string == Correct then we have a correct output
if string != Correct the float states the quality of the output
